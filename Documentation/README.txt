Abstract

Document Search Bot is a web-based application designed to streamline document retrieval using AI-driven search and chatbot interaction. The platform integrates role-based authentication, ensuring secure document management where admins handle uploads and deletions, while users can search and view documents efficiently.

The system leverages React.js for the frontend and Flask for the backend, with ChromaDB used as a vector storage solution to enhance search performance. An AI-powered chatbot (Google Gemini AI) is incorporated to provide intelligent responses, guiding users in document search and answering queries efficiently. The architecture ensures scalability, security, and real-time document retrieval, making it an ideal solution for businesses handling large amounts of data.
